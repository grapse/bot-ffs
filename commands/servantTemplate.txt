Template
* means the field is mandatory. Do not edit the ---||--- fields at all. (you can remove the non basic info ones or swap the order though) 
Fields are denoted by |pipes|. They are not case-sensitive, and the end does not matter (|Name (cannot be edited)|) is the same as |Name|)
Their order also does not matter, and you can delete the non mandatory ones.

The schema for all additional categories are the same, and they are entirely up to you to customize. So the names are only suggestions/general categories.
You can split the additional categories into pages with |page|, pages into embeds with |embed|. If you don't, the bot will automatically split it for you.
Each embed gets its own thumbnail icon |icon|, image |image|, and title |title|. These are all optional.
Discord markdown like **bold**, *italics*, and `code` also work.

You can also delete this part. Or add some notes here if you want. They won't be included.

Do not put sensitive information in this doc. The contents will be stored in a database online (a private one but best to be safe).
The name cannot include slashes or pipes.
Do not use the field tags like '|embed|' or document tags '---|' etc in your actual writing (there shouldn't be a situation where this becomes an issue though)
Using backslashes like escape newlines (\\n) *may* also cause issues, but they aren't really used for anything.
